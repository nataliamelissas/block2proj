CS 3090 Block 2 Project. This repo is a placeholder for my educational technology capstone project which I would distribute under the GNU GPL 3.0 license. 

This project is called Arete and is made to help students achieve their potential in academia. Have you ever felt like you weren't capable of keeping up with your homework assignments or courses? Have you ever wished Canvas could help you organize everthing you need to do based on your existing schedule? My capstone team is currently building a time-management app for students that they can use to organize their assignments, tasks, and study time using actual course data from Canvas. They'll be able to integrate this with their existing calendars and figure out how much to spend on homework, plus quickly have access to instructor help hours on their dashboard.
